  <h1 class="element_color">How does ChatGPT work and do AI-powered chatbot “think” like us?</h1>
  <p class="element_color" id="first_pera">ChatGPT works using a machine learning model called a large language model (LLM), specifically based on transformer
  architecture (like GPT-4). It processes and generates text by predicting the next word based on context, using patterns
  it has learned from vast amounts of text data.</p>
  <div class="element_color"><h2>ChatGPT: Educational friend or foe?</h2>
  <p>On November 30th, 2022, the company OpenAI released a conversational bot called ChatGPT.</p> 
 <section><p>The bot responds to questions that users type in by searching large databases</p></section>
  <p> and creating well-formed essays, legal briefs, poetry in the form of
  Shakespeare, computer code, or lyrics in the form of Rodgers and Hammerstein, to name a few.Some educators and
    commentators fear “The end of high school English”, as students can merely lean on ChatGPT.</p></div>
  <blockquote class="element_color">“The essays produced by ChatGPT are still identifiable as bot-produced, rather than human-produced.”</blockquote>
  <h2>The problem solving types of prompt to use for large language models (LLMs)</h2>
  <h6>Problem-solving prompts hold similarities with creative prompts, but with a more specific purpose: solve a problem.
  “These prompts seek solutions to specific problems or challenges,” said Linnes. When using problem-solving prompts,
  think of ChatGPT as your helpful business mentor.</h6>
